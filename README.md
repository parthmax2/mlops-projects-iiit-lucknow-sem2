# 🐾 Animal Intrusion Detection System

This repository contains a complete **Animal Intrusion Detection System** with:

* A YOLOv8-based deep learning model for detecting animals.
* A web application interface for real-time detection.
* A training pipeline including data ingestion, validation, and model training.

## 🚀 Features

* **YOLOv8**-based animal intrusion detection
* Web application built with **Flask**
* Custom **training pipeline**:

  * **Data Ingestion** from Google Drive
  * **Data Validation**
  * **Model Training** and saving of results
* Easy to run and extend

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

---

### 2. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧠 To Train the Model

```bash
python app.py
```

This will trigger the entire pipeline:

* Download data from Google Drive
* Validate and preprocess the data
* Train YOLOv8 model on the dataset

---

## 🌐 To Run the Web App

```bash
cd animal_detector_webapp
python app.py
```

Once the server starts, open your browser and go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

You can now upload images or test live detection via the UI.

---

## 📁 Notes

* `yolov8n.pt` is the pretrained YOLOv8 model file.
* Training results are saved under `runs/train/`.
* Data is fetched automatically during training.

---

## 🧪 TODO / Future Work

* Integrate real-time CCTV stream
* Deploy web app on cloud (e.g., Render/Heroku)
* Add animal classification (e.g., dangerous/harmless)
