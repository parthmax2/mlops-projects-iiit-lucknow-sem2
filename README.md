# MLOps Projects  – MSc AI-ML | IIIT Lucknow | Semester 2
---
This repository showcases the MLOps course projects developed by MSc AI-ML students of IIIT Lucknow (Semester 2). Each project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning solution following MLOps best practices such as data versioning, experiment tracking, containerization, and reproducibility
---

## Key Objectives

- Implement robust ML pipelines using DVC
- Track experiments, metrics, and models via MLflow
- Containerize services using Docker for cross-platform portability
- Integrate model APIs using FastAPI or Flask
- Enable reproducibility and collaborative development through Git
