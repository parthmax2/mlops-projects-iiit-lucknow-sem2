Dynamic Traffic Light Scheduling

This project implements an intelligent traffic light control system that dynamically adjusts signal timing based on real-time traffic conditions. Using computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system analyzes video feeds from multiple lanes to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and minimize waiting times.

Key Features

Real-time vehicle detection across multiple lanes

Dynamic signal timing based on current traffic density

Adaptive algorithm that learns and improves over time

Web interface for monitoring traffic conditions and system performance

Supports up to 4 lanes with individual video feeds


System Architecture

The system processes video streams from four lanes (A, B, C, and D), analyzes traffic density using a computer vision model, and calculates optimal signal timings. The core components include:

Vehicle detection and counting module

Traffic density analysis

Dynamic signal timing algorithm

Web interface for visualization and control
