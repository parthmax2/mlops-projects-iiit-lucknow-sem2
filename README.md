#  MLOps Projects – MSc AI-ML | IIIT Lucknow | Semester 2

---

## This repository showcases the MLOps course projects developed by MSc AI-ML students of IIIT Lucknow (Semester 2). Each project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning solution using MLOps best practices like data versioning, experiment tracking, containerization, and reproducibility.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

* Build robust ML pipelines using **DVC**
* Track experiments and models using **MLflow**
* Deploy models with **FastAPI** or **Flask**
* Containerize applications using **Docker**
* Maintain reproducibility and version control using **Git**
